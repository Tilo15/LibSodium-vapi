# Vala Bindings for LibSodium

This is something I whipped up one night because I wanted to start a Vala project that relies on LibSodium. After finding around
three different LibSodium VAPI binding projects that all only had around three constants defined, I decided to jump in the deep end and
try writing a VAPI myself.

This still needs Valadoc comments added to function calls to make them more friendly, and I still have not defined all functions
available in LibSodium as I only really needed signatures and sealed boxes. If you do need other functionaliy provided by LibSodium
I am open to pull requests.
